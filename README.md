DHCP stands for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol which is a connectionless network protocol which allows the server to dynamically assign IP address to the incoming hosts and allows them to communicate with other IP networks. Apart from this, it also assigns various other important information to the client system which include subnet mask and gateway.
